## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'CLI_Timeout'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install CLI_Timeout

## Usage

Run ./bin/cli-timeout to start the program. A list of restaurants should pop up on your terminal. Select the number that corresponds with your restaurant to show more information about that restaurant. Type list to display the restaurants again or type exit to exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
